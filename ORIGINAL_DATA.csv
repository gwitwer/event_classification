Shedding familiar influences from the heavily excavated histories of post-punk and krautrock  the band has now beamed into uncharted territory with the otherworldly sound of their third album  Beyond XXXL.On this 11-song excursion  alien strains of synth-pop and glam-rock are sandblasted with smooth guitar solos  eerie electronics  and pulsating drum machines propelled into skull-shattering breakbeats. Deeply distorted vocals narrate the narcoleptic trip like a DJ Screw mixtape splicing together John Foxx  John Maus  and The Prodigy. The result is Freak Heat Waves‚Äô most cohesive and captivating release to date  amplifying earlier melodic sensibilities while remaining singularly strange.   https://freakheatwaves.bandcamp.com/,

However  a chance conversation in 2014 about the success of Youtube cover bands brought the two together to pave a road to quick fortune. Their mix of rocking guitars and electric cello created a unique dynamic  blending their love of rock artists like The Black Keys and folk bands like The Violent Femmes. The resulting music produced a youthful and chaotic frenzy of catchy melodies and raw instrumentals. When the band recruited professional gamer Luke Davis to join the band on drums  The Happy Fits were born.   The band's first single  While You Fade Away  from their debut EP  Awfully Apeelin'  (2016) reached #5 on Spotify's Top 50 Viral USA Chart the first week of its release.  /// Elwood - band ///   Like Tiny Tim took a long drive for someone with nothing to think about and listened to too much Here Come the Warm Jets.  www.elwoodband.bandcamp.com  /// Cyrus Youngman and the Kingfishers ///  Seven twenty-something musicians embark on a musical odyssey between good and evil  as modern bards armed only with their tunes cloaked in rich tones.  http://www.kingfishersband.com,

With the unique instrumentation of vibraphone  keyboard  guitar  and drums they set out to create music that defies genre. The group started with a chance meeting in 2010 at a coffee shop  and a discussion of a shared interest in St. Vincent. The three members  Kristin Agee  Joel Griggs  and Jeff Mellot  began weekly improvisation session  experimenting with their unique sonic possibilities. Improvisations turned into compositions. To date  Us  Today has released three albums. ‚ÄúRH Sessions‚Äù (2011)  ‚ÄúBeneath the Floorboards‚Äù (2012) and ‚ÄúTENENEMIES‚Äù (2015). Each album shows a progression of the band  from a free improvisation background  to a more composed and polished sound. Since their 2015 release  Us  Today has had the pleasure of sharing a stage with Sylvan Esso  Kishi Bashi  Deerhoof  Ghost-Note  and the Mike Dillon Band. They have toured extensively through the midwest  and have played several festivals including Midpoint Music Festival (Cincinnati  OH) and Secret Stages (Birmingham  AL). Their anticipated 4th album ‚ÄúComputant‚Äù (2018) shows another step in their sonic progression  to a more unified  electronic sound.  www.uscommatoday.com  gnz https://soundcloud.com/a_gnzls,

Now  however  times have changed : Faith Healer has turned into a band  with singer-guitarist Jalbert joined by drummer/multi-instrumentalist Renny Wilson. Their first LP as a duo is called Try;-). Balancing melancholic lyrics with playful moods  lush melodies with straight forward arrangements  Try;-) is the sound of an introspective loner leaving her bedroom to make a rock record with her best bud. It‚Äôs what happens when you stop taking life as it comes and instead throw all of your effort into making time-less pop songs. Forget what the bullies told you in middle school‚Äîthere‚Äôs nothing cooler than trying hard. The intensive creative process inspired the title of Try;-) and serves as a reminder that sometimes you need to grab life by the horns rather than waiting  for inspiration to strike. As for that winky face : ‚ÄúI always use that wink emoticon ‚Äù Jalbert says with a laugh. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs hilarious. I think it‚Äôs cheeky and fun  which is something  I was trying to access a little more with this record.‚Äù http://www.faithhealer.ca  Elle Barbara's Black Space Elle Barbara (J.

With the addition of producer and engineer Brian Deck (Modest Mouse  Iron & Wine) Hall crashes through the aforementioned subject matter with brightness and lucidity  yielding his most intelligent and focused songwriting yet. Working out of his house with Deck in Pilsen  Chicago  Hall‚Äôs efforts yield ten tracks of spacious and textured handmade pop  comprising one of the most sharply written and deftly recorded home-studio albums in memory. https://www.intallbuildings.com/  Saint Aubin Saint Aubin is the collective work of Trevor St. Aubin  Fredrick Miller III  and Tom Sargent. Their sound has been described as  a soulful collision of alt-rock  and jazzy folk music  by The Anchored Soul Blog. Although St. Aubin has only existed for a few months  their music is far from immature. With years of experience under their belts  this trio is ready to change the way you view the sounds that can come from just three musicians. http://saintaubinmusic.com,

Born in Toronto  the musician spent 2016 in Detroit  where the musically fertile and offbeat neighborhood of Hamtramck became both his home and the inspiration for a new set of recordings. Hamtramck '16 documents his arrival into a new and unfamiliar environment combined with a growing obsession for underground dance music  a sound and spirit that has always felt right at home in Detroit. Collaborating with local artists and musicians  and having the freedom to stretch out after several years of constant touring  Daniel put together a completely new band with a sound drawing from dance music's early days  from synthpop  disco and house music up through the more pop-oriented songcraft of the Bee Gees or Prince. Daniel's attention to detail in production  and willingness to break the mold of what he sees as his own potential  have made him an interesting figure to watch. With Hamtramck '16 he has created a lo-fi pop gem that will leave listeners eager to hear what comes next. https://moon-king.bandcamp.com/  MK-II Jacob Gardner's analog synth project  coupled with vocals by Michael Anderson  D.

He is also a poet and visual artist. With Frontier Ruckus  Milia has tirelessly toured the United States and Europe since 2008garnering a devoted cult following and performing at major music festivals such as Bonnaroo  Lollapalooza  and End of the Road in the United Kingdom. Known for his obsession toward nostalgic detail  Milia has written over 100 songs constructing an intricate personal mythology based on his lifelong home of Detroit  Michigan. His debut solo album  Alone at St. Hugo  is scheduled for a 2018 release. http://www.matthewmilia.com  Peter Oren Indiana-born  everywhere-based singer-songwriter Peter Oren possesses a remarkable singing voice  low and deep and richly textured: as solid as a glacier  as big as a mountain. Similar in its baritone gravel to Bill Callahan  a hero of his  it rumbles in your conscience  a righteous sound that marks him as an artist for our tumultuous times  when sanity seems absent from popular discussions. His voice is ideally suited to confront a topic as large and as ominous as the Anthropocene Age. His new LP 'Anthropocene' arrives November 10th via Western Vinyl.  http://peteroren.com/  Caleb McCoach What separates a songwriter from the incoherent  corner store madman or a purveyor of cheap parlor tricks? The crux of this answer lies in an ability to reveal universal  essential truths to the listener in a way that feels simultaneously effortless and impossible. The best songwriters achieve this end regardless of genre or format. Caleb McCoach is one of those  https://calebmccoach.bandcamp.com/album/gone-forever,

After a decade of composing and performing around the country largely under the radar  in 2015 a viral facebook video of his song ‚ÄúButter II‚Äù introduced his music to over 6 million listeners around the world in the course of a month. In addition to a record deal and endorsements with companies such as Ovation guitars and Boss pedals  2016 provided extensive touring opportunities throughout Europe and the United States  including two performances with a full symphony orchestra. Fingerstyle legend Don Ross invited Case to open for him in Ross‚Äô then-hometown of Toronto  later describing his performance as ‚Äúsome of the most massively inventive musicianship I‚Äôve ever heard/seen.‚Äù Other listeners have described his music as a cross between Michael Hedges and Pat Metheny.  His latest album   Earth Suite  (coming in October 2017)  features nearly a dozen musicians from all over the globe  including four-time Grammy-winning cellist Eugene Friesen and internationally acclaimed percussionist Jamey Haddad. While the studio album features a large group and dense orchestration  Case brings much of that expansive sound to his 2017-2018 concert performances thanks to live looping and sound specialist Stephanie Case who records  layers  and manipulates Ian‚Äôs playing on the spot for a dynamic  truly symphonic effect that defies the typical ‚Äúsolo musician with a loop pedal‚Äù stereotype. As one first-time listener in California exclaimed  ‚ÄúIan‚Äôs music is phenomenal - watching him play is not ‚Äòlistening to music‚Äô; it‚Äôs a full mind experience. Transporting.‚Äù  Joining Ian will be percussionist and recent Berklee College of Music graduate Daniel Feldman. Originally from Mexico and having also lived in the Middle East  Feldman‚Äôs unique background has contributed to a rare mastery of both latin and arabic percussion  all fused with a creative  borderless approach to music.  WEBSITE: http://www.IanEthan.com  ----  A sonic feast  an epic journey both aurally and conceptually...Each piece is a mini-symphony that holds the attention fully. Run Toward the Mountains [is] a major achievement which is sure to confirm Case among the ranks of significant artists at work today.  - C√©line Keating  Minor7th.com  ‚ÄúIt was refreshing to witness a guitarist who has created his own style and is not emulating a host of other players.‚Äù - Devon ‚ÄúDoc‚Äù Wendell  The International Review of Music,

They joined forces in 2014  inspired by the free improvisational music scene in Chicago  and influenced by folk and avant-garde rock. Their combined vocal and musical talents yield an incredible dichotomy of harmony and chaos that leaves the audience wanting more. OHMME has been compared to PJ Harvey  Nirvana  and Kate Bush  but their innate chemistry creates something uniquely satisfying and wholly different from their predecessors. Their self-titled EP will be released on June 30  2017 on Fox Hall Records. You can find more information on their website - http://www.ohmmemusic.com .  Hen The girls in Hen seem to be reliving their suburban family pre-teen years of dance academy recitals and neighborhood side-lawn choreography. They're now pushing 30 writing songs that sound like they were written on swings  and performing as self-anointed starlets who should perhaps know better by now. The difference is they do know better and do it anyway in a bawdy move to entertain and limber up the immediate vicinity with new old-fashioned cheers & jeers. http://www.panyrosasdiscos.net/2014/03/john-collins-mccormick-sky-thing-pre-emptive-best-of-2014/  Dove Indy minimal electro-pop https://doveband.bandcamp.com/releases,

 Knot Brothers
 2016 was an interesting year to say the least for the Knot Brothers. In their first year as a band they quickly became a staple of the Indianapolis music scene and took the city by storm playing their unique combination of rock  rap  and pop music that draws inspiration from acts such as Chromeo  Daft Punk  and Gym Class Heroes. Knot Brothers' combination of driving bass lines and fun loving party lyrics make them an unstoppable force of music  and they're just getting started.

After relocating to Los Angeles in 2012  his demos caught the ears of some local musicians and labels  eventually finding their way to Stones Throws‚Äô Peanut Butter Wolf. After signing with Stones Throw  Mild High Club released their debut LP in September 2015  which Pitchfork described as ‚Äúa record full of psychedelic soft rock that draws strongly from White-album era Beatles and T-Rex  with swirls of '80s-indebted synthpop.‚Äù  The band quickly became a preferred supporting act on the road  touring with King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard  Allah-las  Quilt  Youth Lagoon  Wire  and appearing at festivals near and wide  their live act described as ‚Äúhypnotizing and ethereal‚Äù.   The release of 2016‚Äôs Skiptracing was a major step forward for the band  which Aquarium Drunkard described as a ‚Äúcool  grooving blend of lo-fi psych  lounge  and exotica‚Äù  a thematic  psychedelic jazz-pop odyssey whose story arc follows a private investigator attempting to trace the steps of the sound and the spirit of American music.  CHIVES  From one man stomp - to three piece roll - to four or five piece psych trample  the talented and young chives does it all. He's been making quite a name for himself since he came onto the indy scene  as both a visual artist and as a fab rock n roll performer. This show finds the Chives band about a year into its evolution in the Indy scene - they're tighter and louder than ever  and that shriek is still on fleek.  - Miss Mess https://chivess.bandcamp.com/,

Her work most recently won NPR Music‚Äôs 2016 Tiny Desk Contest  a competition drawing submissions of  original songs from more than 6 000 musicians across the country. Gaelynn Lea has been playing violin for over twenty  years  developing an improvisational style all her own. She has performed alongside many notable Minnesota musicians  over the years  including Alan Sparhawk  Charlie Parr  and Billy McLaughlin. Check out her Tiny Desk Conert here : https://violinscratches.com/  Bigfoot Yancey Bigfoot Yancey is an Indianapolis-based band that has developed a sound that draws upon inspiration from various genres but always rooted in Americana and the blue collar sound that has defined many parts of this country for decades. In an era where more and more musicians are relying upon technology  Bigfoot Yancey strives to keep their music as raw and stripped down as possible. This allows the listener to fully engage with the music in a very real sense. Their live performances echo this raw  down home feel with energetic and lively performances that acclimate themselves very easily in a wide variety of settings. The band has developed a solid following in the Indianapolis area by identifying themselves as the blue collar boys next door that just so happen to play a mean guitar  banjo  harmonica  and even a saw.  Achilles Tenderloin A college librarian by day  Joe Augustine  aka Achilles Tenderloin  travels the tri-state area by night  making ink drawings and playing original songs. He considers himself a lyricist  more than anything  but over the years his untrtrained vocal and guitar chops have evolved into an unusual  recognizable style. His latest album  Stronger Than Wine  was released in August 2014 and features Cincinnati native Aaron Nell on trumpet and fiddle. The album was recorded and mixed by Chris Yakopcic at Street Sounds Recording Studio  in Dayton  OH. Stronger Than Wine is available on Bandcamp:  http://achillestenderloin.bandcamp.com,

The group was so hot that their first rehearsal became a show. So many people had lined up outside the venue  they decided to just charge admission and let everybody in! They were the top musicians on the island at the time  having come together after playing in different bands and on various recording sessions. These records were made to be played at the many competing sound systems around the island. The band became legendary  backing all the developing artists of the day  such as Toots and The Maytals  Prince Buster and ‚ÄúThe Wailing Wailers‚Äù featuring Bob Marley  Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer. These groups were all recording on the new beat called ska  which had an infectious rhythm that was catching on like wildfire. Eventually  the beat slowed down into rocksteady  and then reggae. This wildfire spread unstoppably around the world  developing into a huge musical tree with many stylistic branches  including lovers rock  dub  dancehall/ ragga  ska-punk   and others. Hugely popular groups  like The Police  The Clash  The Specials  The English Beat  Sublime and No Doubt  all have their roots firmly planted in the music of The Skatalites.  Since reforming after an almost 20 year hiatus in 1983  and beginning regular touring as a unit in 1989  they have not stopped thrilling audiences in every corner of the globe. Even after more than 50 years  and various lineup changes as members leave one stage for another  the band continues to perform and record new music in the inimitable Jamaican style  like only they can. The road has been long and hard  and sadly  seen most of the original members pass on. Often asked ‚Äúwhen will you stop?‚Äù and ‚Äúhow do you keep doing it after all these years?‚Äù  the answer is simple: never ‚Äì It‚Äôs the love of the music and the way our fans respond that keep us going Forward!  Featuring original  vocalist Doreen Shaffer  along with the current lineup of outstanding musicians they have chosen to accompany them  the band proudly presents live the music of Jamaican Ska. Forever indebted to the inspiration and talent of: Roland Alphonso  Lloyd Brevett  Don Drummond  Jerome ‚ÄúJah Jerry‚Äù Haynes  Lloyd Knibb  Tommy McCook  Donat ‚ÄúJackie‚Äù Mittoo  John ‚ÄúDizzy Johnny‚ÄùMoore  and Lester Sterling  collectively known as The Skatalites. http://www.skatalites.com/    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////^\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\  Sweet Poison Victim  Trying to describe Sweet Poison Victim can be a bit difficult. Sure  there are some familiar elements in their music  from the plucky pop of West African High-Life to   the rhythmic groove of Reggae and Cumbia to the impassioned wail of classic Soul   and the hypnotic pulse of garage rock  but the final product is impossible to pigeonhole. Their influences are mutated  melted down and molded into something new and wonderful. Something that has to be seen and heard in order to be believed. But don‚Äôt waste your time trying to describe their sound. Just remember to dance. https://sweetpoisonvictim.bandcamp.com/   Louie Louie  Louie Louie is not a revivalist band. On stage they might toss out grooves reminiscent of Little Richard and Chuck Berry  and hit a swing as melodically addictive as Martha and the Vandellas. Their raw energy on stage has been described as cacophonous and untoward  a fresh breath of air in a seemingly old package. Louie Louie is the contemporary answer to the aging of sounds we love. https://louielouieinc.bandcamp.com/,

The group‚Äôs debut  I Am the Morning  followed in 2013. The alt-country styled album was a limited success  spawning a cult following in the US and some international critical praise  allowing the band to continue touring on the DIY circuit  where changes in personnel and taste saw the band exploring territory beyond the genre. Quiet Hollers signed with the indie label SonaBLAST! for their third album  Amen Breaks. The album draws parallels between the modern entertainment landscape and the cultural crossover of the 1970s‚Äì another decade marred by division  political corruption  and terrorist bombs. Their shape-shifting palate makes use of orchestral strings and brass  vintage drum-machines and samples (including the Amen Break  the most sampled piece of music in history). Amen Breaks explores themes of spirituality  sexuality  and mental illness. http://www.quiethollers.com/#home-section  JOSHUA POWELL (of Joshua Powell & the Great Train Robbery) Over the years  Powell has carved out a niche in his new home by setting his hyper-literate lyrics to broad swaths of psych-folk and shedding the vocal affectations of a varied past. As Powell and his transiently shifting backing band have extrapolated this sound  they have played over 400 shows  opened for such national acts as Mike Mains & the Branches  Seabird  and The Soil & the Sun  and played festivals like Indy Folk Fest (IN)  Starry Night (IN ) Midpoint Music Fest (OH)  and Lincoln Calling (NE). When Powell‚Äôs not sweet-talking the interstate  he can be found at the local dive bar reading Hesse or Brautigan and scribbling potential poems. http://joshuapowellmusic.com/  CHARLIE BALLANTINE PROVIDENCE BAND Charlie Ballantine has been making waves in the Indianapolis music scene for years. Earning a reputation as one of the best jazz guitarists in the city as well as producing quite a few well received and critically acclaimed records that merge folk sensibilities with virtuosic ability. Adjacently  the Providence Band takes a step away from the roots-rock-inspired jams of Charlie's self-titled project and delves instead into the world of psychedelic textures and melodic grooves.,

The songs were a collection of old demos thrown together into a six-song EP for a friend's semester project. A year later  the same friend approached Krauter with the idea for another six-song project. This time  Krauter had been writing new songs over the past year with the intention of releasing them together on an album. What resulted is a cohesive collection of songs that range from a multitude of influences from bossa nova to Americana. Each song is born from a different emotional/personal background  but they each follow a theme of change and growth. Using his solo work as an outlet for non-Hoops material  Changes is Krauter‚Äôs first attempt at writing and recording a set of songs that flow together thematically while maintaining their own distinctive sound and feeling. Changes is out December 2nd on Winspear & Warm Ratio. https://kevinkrauter.bandcamp.com/  Crescent Ulmer Singer-songwriter based out of Indiana.

Their raw energy on stage has been described as cacophonous and untoward  a fresh breath of air in a seemingly old package.

He‚Äôs currently signed to Planet Mu as a solo artist about to release his new album 'Devout' on the follow up to his critically acclaimed debut LP ‚ÄòParallel Memories‚Äô. As a producer/co-writer he has worked with grime stalwarts Skepta  P-Money and more recently with r&b/electronic star Katy B. He is fast becoming a go-to producer/writer outside of the instrumental grime sphere.  Mr. Mitch is steadily  but forcefully pushing the boundaries of electronic music and pop culture in a way only he does  releasing his second album on Planet Mu in April 2017. It‚Äôs about love  loyalty  family and the start and end of relationships  with an overarching theme about becoming a father  all delivered with warmth and emotion. Miles even sings and so does his eldest son Milo on one track. About the theme he says  ‚Äúwe all know the stereotype of the black dad with multiple children from multiple partners who is absent from the child‚Äôs life  we see it consistently in popular culture. I want to champion the alternative  which to me is just normal.‚Äù  As well as being a producer Miles is the co-founder of the Boxed nights  which have been a tight incubator of a music scene dedicated in the main to re-thinking and expanding what grime means  especially instrumental grime. Mitch has always taken it further than most in a unique direction  defining his music led by his own personality rather than deferring to a scene consensus. An early example was his development of ‚Äòpeace edits‚Äô in response to the aggressive ‚Äòwar dubs‚Äô craze amongst other grime producers  around the time of his first album.  Production-wise Mr. Mitch has always been a minimalist at heart  pushing detailed sound and melody around in space  but on Devout everything is more ambitious  emotive and polished  taking his music in an epic and well defined pop direction  albeit from a sideways angle  re-imagining what an album by an underground producer can be.  Devout‚Äôs cast of male and female allies  MC‚Äôs and singers each deliver songs that cast perspective around the album‚Äôs theme. Mr. Mitch sets the scene with the graceful honesty of the piano led intro  then P Money drops a heartfelt and emotional lyric about the charge of love and responsibility experienced on becoming a dad. Denai Moore‚Äôs song ‚ÄòFate‚Äô is open about being sceptical in allowing yourself to fall for someone at the start of a relationship  while Palmistry‚Äôs track ‚ÄòVPN‚Äô explores his feelings after separation. The warm centre of ‚ÄòDevout‚Äô is ‚ÄòMy Life‚Äôs heart-tugging Sakamoto-like melody and bent keys  with Miles gently intoning ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs yours‚Äù and final song ‚ÄòOscar‚Äô tells a newborn his brother will be an elder brother. Devout is a beautiful  grown-up pop record with its foundation in grime.  NPR's first listen to Mr Mitch's latest album 'Devout' : http://www.npr.org/2017/04/13/523606071/first-listen-mr-mitch-devout   OREO JONES  Oreo Jones is that pair of Air Jordans too scuffed up to wear in public  but you do it anyway because they still feel right.

Cold minerals  flashlight throws and echoes in dark chambers of imperceptible size is what it sounds like.  Oldness in the now  it sounds like.  Archives scribed by eons of dissolving and redepositing the hard stuff by the wet stuff.  Insulated by the ground for a ceiling that every person was born  lived  died in  born  lived  died in.  Sounds like thick clicks  veiled encounters  damp stops  pools of tone-feel.  Sounds like real memory.   David  Moose  Adamson continues to work in fascinating textures and arrangements  both dance-inducing and descriptive. 'OOBYDOOB' is the second release with his Sedcairn Archives project. This time he's invited some of his favorite musicians to leave their prints on the walls.    -Lisa Berlin https://sedcairnarchives.bandcamp.com/album/oobydoob,

Rare   because what draws these two dudes together seems hard to find; a studious  almost aggressive  attraction and ambition toward moderation.'                                                                 https://spissyband.bandcamp.com/   JACKSON VANHORN  https://jacksonvanhorn.bandcamp.com/,

Bryan will be pouring wines from Venato  and Slovenia. Details Below  Veneto  De Stefani/Redentore The family of De Stefani dates back to the later half of the 1800‚Äôs  having created wines of the utmost quality since the beginning  and continuing today under the experience of the family‚Äôs fourth generation winemaker  Alessandro.  The family began in Refrontolo  a small hilly village in between the two famous Prosecco towns of Conegliano and Valdobbiadene  and more recently has accrued two other vineyards to combine for 40 hectares of total estate. With a complete dedication to as natural production as possible  the estate is organically farmed  they only rely on naturally occurring yeasts as well as never adding sulfur during vinification (since 2009)  all while focusing on many varietals that they have found to create incredible results in their unique terrain.  Thriving from the local clay soils  the wines of De Stefani are stunning  true to type  and richly complex.  Slovenia  Stekar  The ≈†tekar family started with humble beginnings in the Gori≈°ka Brda zone of Slovenia back in 1985.  With only a few hectares of vines  they were farmers for a nearby cooperative until they began to grow and have the means to start their own winery.  Today  still small and dedicated to the best fruit they can grow; they farm 10 hectares of vines and produce 35 000 bottles in total.  Combined with another 22 hectares of cherry orchards  as well as an agriturismo  Roman ≈†tekar  and his son Jure  run this lovely natural winery in the stunning hills of western Slovenia.  In 2006  the winery received its organic certification  showing further their commitment to low-impact start-to-finish wine making which they have supported since the beginning.  Their use of neutral oak barrels  tiny amounts of SO2  and pure expressions of the locally used varietals; proves to working for them as they continue with their gorgeous winery in one of the most famous ‚Äònatural‚Äô wine regions of the world.,
