# Event Classification using Matlab, Python

These files have not been organized yet.

As they become so moving forward, please update this file with appropriate descriptions.

The files "attending_interested_[category].csv" contain the data.

The data in these files are CSVs with columns attending, interested, day of week classification

The genre categories (electronic, rock, hiphop, other), taken together, represent the entire data set.

The day of week categories (weekday, weekend), taken together, also represent the entire data set.

That is, there are two ways to combine these files to get the entire data set.
Note: put them into separate directories to make this more apparent.
